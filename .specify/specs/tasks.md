Setup Tasks (T001-T002)
├── Test Tasks [P] (T003-T008) - can run in parallel after setup
├── Core Tasks (T009-T018) - depend on tests (TDD approach)
│   ├── T009 (Auth) → T010 (Layout) → T011 (Design System)
│   ├── T012 (Patient Search) → T013 (Patient CRUD) → T014 (Visit Mgmt)

├── Integration Tasks (T019-T023) - depend on core implementation
└── Polish Tasks [P] (T024-T030) - can run in parallel after integration
```

## Parallel Execution Examples

After completing T001-T002 (setup), you can run test tasks in parallel:

```
# Run contract tests in parallel
T003 & T004 & T005 & T006 & T007 & T008
```

After core implementation, run polish tasks in parallel:

```
# Run polish tasks in parallel
T024 & T025 & T026 & T027 & T028 & T029 & T030
```
