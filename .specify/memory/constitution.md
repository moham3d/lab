# Patient Visit Management System Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Patient Data Privacy and HIPAA Compliance
All patient data handling must comply with HIPAA regulations. Personal health information (PHI) must be encrypted at rest and in transit. Access to PHI requires explicit consent and proper authentication. Data retention policies must follow healthcare compliance standards. Audit logs must track all PHI access and modifications.

### II. Role-Based Access Control
System implements strict role-based access control with three primary roles: nurses (data entry and basic assessments), physicians (full patient access and medical decisions), and admins (system configuration and user management). Each role has clearly defined permissions and access levels. No role escalation is permitted.

### III. Data Integrity and Audit Trails
All data modifications must be logged with full audit trails including who, when, what, and why. Database transactions must maintain ACID properties. Data validation occurs at multiple layers. Backup and recovery procedures must ensure data integrity.

### IV. Scalable and Maintainable Architecture
Architecture must support horizontal scaling for increased patient load. Code must follow clean architecture principles with clear separation of concerns. Modular design enables independent deployment of services. Comprehensive documentation and automated testing ensure maintainability.

### V. Comprehensive Error Handling
All operations must have proper error handling with meaningful error messages. System must gracefully handle network failures, database timeouts, and invalid inputs. Error logging must include sufficient context for debugging while protecting sensitive data.

### VI. Healthcare Workflow Optimization
System design must optimize healthcare workflows by reducing redundant data entry, providing intelligent form pre-population, and supporting parallel processing of assessments. User interfaces must follow healthcare UX best practices for efficiency and accuracy.

### VII. Security-First Approach
Security considerations drive all design decisions. Input validation, SQL injection prevention, XSS protection, and secure authentication are mandatory. Regular security audits and penetration testing required. Zero-trust architecture principles applied throughout.

## Technical Standards
- Technology Stack: PostgreSQL database, RESTful API design, JWT authentication
- Compliance: HIPAA, GDPR healthcare data requirements
- Performance: Response times <500ms for 95th percentile, support 1000+ concurrent users
- Reliability: 99.9% uptime, automated failover, comprehensive monitoring
- Security: End-to-end encryption, regular security updates, vulnerability scanning

## Development Standards
- Code Review: All changes require peer review with security and compliance checklist
- Testing: Unit tests >80% coverage, integration tests for all workflows, security testing
- Documentation: API documentation, data flow diagrams, compliance documentation
- Deployment: Blue-green deployments, automated rollback capability, environment segregation
- Monitoring: Real-time health checks, error tracking, performance monitoring

## Governance
Constitution supersedes all other practices. Amendments require approval from compliance officer and technical lead. All changes must maintain HIPAA compliance. Breaking changes require migration plan and user communication. Regular compliance audits required.
