- [ ] Set up production environment variables (.env file)
- [ ] Configure SSL certificates for HTTPS
- [ ] Set up domain name and DNS records
- [ ] Configure firewall rules (ports 80, 443, 5432 for DB if needed)

### 2. Security Configuration
- [ ] Generate strong passwords for all services
- [ ] Set up SSL/TLS certificates (Let's Encrypt or commercial)

- [ ] Set up proper file permissions (755 for directories, 644 for files)
- [ ] Configure backup encryption keys

### 3. Infrastructure Requirements
- [ ] Ensure Docker and Docker Compose are installed
- [ ] Verify minimum system requirements:
  - CPU: 2+ cores
  - RAM: 4GB+ minimum, 8GB+ recommended
  - Storage: 20GB+ free space
- [ ] Set up monitoring and alerting system
- [ ] Configure log rotation and retention policies

## Deployment Steps

### 4. Database Setup
- [ ] Start PostgreSQL container
- [ ] Verify database initialization with schema
- [ ] Run database migrations if needed
- [ ] Create database backup before going live

### 5. Application Deployment
- [ ] Build application Docker image
- [ ] Start all services with docker-compose
- [ ] Verify all services are running
- [ ] Run health checks on all endpoints
- [ ] Test API endpoints with sample requests

### 6. Nginx Configuration
- [ ] Update nginx.conf with production domain
- [ ] Configure SSL certificates in nginx
- [ ] Set up proper proxy headers
- [ ] Configure rate limiting rules
- [ ] Test SSL configuration with SSL Labs

## Post-Deployment Verification

### 7. Functional Testing
- [ ] Test user authentication (login/logout)
- [ ] Test patient CRUD operations
- [ ] Test visit management functionality
- [ ] Test document upload/download
- [ ] Test assessment forms
- [ ] Test admin reporting features

### 8. Security Testing
- [ ] Verify HTTPS enforcement
- [ ] Test security headers (HSTS, CSP, etc.)
- [ ] Verify rate limiting is working
- [ ] Test input validation and sanitization
- [ ] Check for exposed sensitive information

### 9. Performance Testing
- [ ] Test application response times
- [ ] Verify database query performance
