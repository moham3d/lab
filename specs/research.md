# Research Findings

## Decision: FastAPI for Backend Framework
**Rationale**: FastAPI provides automatic OpenAPI documentation, type safety with Pydantic, async support for high concurrency, and modern Python features. Ideal for healthcare APIs requiring performance and reliability.

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Django REST Framework: More batteries-included but heavier for async operations
- Flask: Lightweight but requires more manual setup for validation and docs
- Express.js: Good but Python ecosystem better for data science integrations

## Decision: PostgreSQL with SQLAlchemy 2.0
**Rationale**: ACID compliance for healthcare data integrity, async support with asyncpg, advanced features for complex queries and relationships.

**Alternatives Considered**:
- MySQL: Good performance but less async support
- MongoDB: Flexible schema but weaker ACID guarantees
- SQLite: Simple but not scalable for concurrent users

## Decision: JWT with Refresh Tokens
**Rationale**: Stateless authentication suitable for REST APIs, refresh mechanism for security, standard in healthcare systems.

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Session-based auth: State management complexity
- OAuth2 flows: Overkill for internal API
- API keys: Less secure for user-specific access

## Decision: Pydantic for Validation
**Rationale**: Type-safe validation, automatic serialization, custom validators for medical data formats.

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Marshmallow: Good but less integrated with FastAPI
- Cerberus: Dict-based, less type safety
- Manual validation: Error-prone and repetitive

## Decision: Async/Await Pattern
**Rationale**: Better concurrency for database operations, improved performance under load, modern Python best practice.

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Synchronous: Blocking operations limit scalability
- Threads: GIL limitations in Python
- Multiprocessing: Higher resource usage

## Decision: Role-Based Access Control with Dependencies
**Rationale**: Clean separation of concerns, compile-time safety, easy testing of permissions.

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Middleware-based: Less granular control
- Database-level: Slower and harder to test
- Application-level decorators: Less reusable

## Decision: Alembic for Migrations
**Rationale**: Native SQLAlchemy integration, version control for schema changes, production-safe migrations.

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Manual SQL: Error-prone and hard to track
- Django migrations: Not applicable for FastAPI
- Flyway: Good but less Python-native

## Decision: Comprehensive Testing with pytest
**Rationale**: Async support, fixtures for database testing, extensive plugin ecosystem.

**Alternatives Considered**:
- unittest: Built-in but less convenient for async
- nose: Deprecated
- behave: BDD but overkill for unit tests

## Decision: Docker Containerization
**Rationale**: Consistent deployment, environment isolation, easy scaling with orchestration.

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Virtual environments: No container benefits
- Bare metal: Environment inconsistencies
- Serverless: May not fit all healthcare workflows

## Decision: HIPAA Compliance Measures
**Rationale**: End-to-end encryption, audit logging, data retention policies, secure file handling.

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Basic security: Insufficient for healthcare
- Custom compliance: Risk of missing requirements
- Third-party tools: Integration complexity

## Decision: Background Tasks with Celery
**Rationale**: Async report generation, heavy operations off main thread, Redis for message broker.

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Synchronous processing: Blocks API responses
- Thread pools: Limited scalability
- External services: Integration overhead

## Decision: File Upload with Validation
**Rationale**: Async uploads, MIME type validation, secure storage, size limits.

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Synchronous uploads: Poor performance
- No validation: Security risks
- External storage: Additional complexity
