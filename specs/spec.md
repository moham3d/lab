## **Key Python/FastAPI Specific Features:**

1. **Automatic Documentation** - FastAPI generates interactive Swagger UI
2. **Type Safety** - Pydantic models ensure type validation
3. **Async Performance** - Better concurrency for database operations
4. **Dependency Injection** - Clean authentication and authorization
5. **Background Tasks** - For heavy report generation
6. **Modern Python** - Leverages latest Python features

Use this specification with your `/specify` command, and it will generate a production-ready FastAPI healthcare backend!"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   → If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   → Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   → Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   → If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   → Each requirement must be testable
   → Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   → If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   → If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ⚡ Quick Guidelines
- ✅ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ❌ Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- 👥 Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a healthcare professional, I want to manage patient visits through a backend API so that I can archive visits, perform nursing and radiology assessments, and store documents securely.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a nurse has patient information, **When** they search or create a patient using SSN, mobile, or medical number, **Then** the patient record is found or created successfully.
2. **Given** a patient exists, **When** a nurse creates a new visit and completes the nursing assessment, **Then** the visit is recorded with assessment data.
3. **Given** an open visit exists, **When** a physician reviews it and completes the radiology assessment, **Then** the assessment is saved and diagnosis can be updated.
4. **Given** a visit has documents to upload, **When** documents are uploaded, **Then** they are stored securely with unique naming.
5. **Given** an admin needs reports, **When** they request comprehensive reports, **Then** reports are generated showing dashboard, statistics, volume, and assessments.

### Edge Cases
- What happens when a patient SSN is invalid or duplicate?
- How does the system handle concurrent access to the same patient record?
- What occurs if a document upload fails due to size or type restrictions?
- How are errors handled when assessment data is incomplete?
- What security measures prevent unauthorized access to patient data?

- **FR-013**: System MUST manage nursing assessments (SH.MR.FRM.05).
- **FR-014**: System MUST manage radiology assessments (SH.MR.FRM.04).
- **FR-015**: System MUST store documents securely.
- **FR-016**: System MUST enforce role-based access control.

- **FR-018**: System MUST validate medical data formats (e.g., SSN, mobile numbers).
- **FR-019**: System MUST handle file uploads with size and type validation.
- **FR-020**: System MUST provide patient history views.

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Patient**: Represents a patient with attributes like SSN, mobile number, medical number, full name, date of birth, gender.
- **User**: Represents system users with roles (nurse, physician, admin) and permissions.
- **Patient Visit**: Represents a visit linked to a patient, including date and status.
- **Nursing Assessment**: Contains assessment data like vital signs, pain assessment, fall risk.
- **Radiology Assessment**: Contains radiology-specific assessment data.
- **Document**: Represents uploaded documents linked to visits.
- **Audit Log**: Records all actions for compliance.
